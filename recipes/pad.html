    <h3> Notes </h3>

    <p>  Several theories exist on the naming of this dish.  One theory holds that it was devised by someone who came home drunk but still wanted something to eat that could be made easily with whatever ingredients were available. As such it should actually be renamed "drunkard's noodles". Yet another theory states that this dish is so spicy that one needs to drink beer to temper the heat.</p>
