<h3>Github - Wercker - Heroku</h3>

<h4>By: Robin Swenson-Healey</h4><br/><br/>

Ruby on Rails developers have a lot to think about when they start an application.  Going from idea to production
may seem like a daunting task but in fact it has never been easier.  Using a couple of (mostly) free resources
a web dev can automate most of their flow without sacrificing autonomy or code integrity. <br/>

To move from project to production requires three main processes:
<ul>
  <li>Distributed Version Control</li>
  <li>Constant, Automated Integration Testing</li>
  <li>A functioning Production Server</li>
</ul>

We can connect these three together into the ultimate app <b>Triple Threat</b>.


As a Rails Developer, we take for granted <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-the-blog-application">step one</a> in our project creation.

<h5>But what about step 2?</h5>

Step two is <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">version control</a>.  With a Distributed Version Control System(DVCS) such as Git
we can keep our code changes orderly and remote.  This way, any negative changes or local
corruptions can be rolled back.  Plus collaboration becomes much easier.

<h4>Github for DVCS</h4>
Github offers us this DVCS free of charge, as long as our code is public.  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">Get over there and
create an account</a>:

<a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/robinportfolio/git-signup.png"/></a>

And lets get our local directory covered, as a repository:

<a href="https://github.com/new"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/robinportfolio/git-new-repo.png"/></a>

From here add changes or new files, <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html"> write a good commit message</a> and push them to Github.<br/><br/>

Great, but now what?<br/>

<h4>Automated Testing with Wercker</h4>

<a href="https://app.wercker.com/sessions/new">Wercker</a> is an up and coming remote automated testing suite, similar to <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis-CI</a> or <a href="http://www.drone.io">Drone.io</a>.
While currently in beta all testing is free of charge, even for private repos.  They also have
a very comprehensive <a href="http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/introduction/security.html">explanation</a> of how your code will be kept safe from prying eyes.

Go on over and create an <a href="https://app.wercker.com/sessions/new">account!</a></br>

Now that wasn't so hard.  The best thing? <a href="http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/introduction/deploys.html">Github integration!</a>
Wercker smoothly slides you from<a href="https://app.wercker.com/#applications/create"> step to step</a>: </br>

<ol>
<li>Go to 'MyApps' and click 'Add an application'
<img></li>

<li>An option is presented for both Github and Bitbucket integration.  Click on that Github 'Connect'.</li>

<li>Select your Github repository from the populated list.</li>

<li>And Add 'werckerbot' as a collaborator on your project in Github:<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/robinportfolio/weckerbot.png"/></li>

<li>Wercker creates a 'wercker.yml' file just for your app, which you need to drop into your
app's root directory.  For my Ruby on rails app, I needed to change the first line: <br/>

<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/robinportfolio/wercker-box.png"/></br>

But your app might be different depending on what box you'd like it to run on.  The
<a href="http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/werckeryml/#box">box options</a> are laid out, so pick what works best for your environment.
</li></ol><br/>

Ta da!  Every time you make a commit, Wercker will run your tests and let you know if anything
is failing. You can check this on your Wercker Builds tab within your project. <br/>


<h4> Heroku, the free Production Server </h4>

When you are ready to present your app to the world, there is no better first step then
<a href="https://id.heroku.com/signup"> Heroku </a>.

You will need to install their <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com"> toolbelt </a> so that you can use terminal commands
for Heroku. After creating an account and receiving confirmation, you can login to heroku within bash:

<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/robinportfolio/heroku-login.png"/>

Of note is that Heroku uses PostgreSQL as its database, but Rails 3 defaults to SQLite.
You can either <a href="http://bigbangtechnology.com/post/installing_postgresql_on_mac_os_x/"> set up your app with PostgreSQL </a>
or simply set pg for production in your Gemfile (with rails_12factor):
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/robinportfolio/pg-gemfile.png"/>

You will also need to modify your database.yml and config/application.rb slightly:
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/robinportfolio/production-gems.png"/><br/>

<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/robinportfolio/config-heroku.png"/>

NOTICE: setting up is <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4"> slightly different </a> for rails 4.

From here, make sure your app is already in a git repo and in your terminal:
```
cd ~/myapp
heroku create
git push heroku master
```
But realistically, who wants to push heroku manually when Wercker will do it for us?
Wercker already tests our commits, but it can also automatically push passing commits to Heroku.
Simply visit Wercker's page for your project and click on your most recent commit, and click that big
blue button:

<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/robinportfolio/blue-button.png"/>

You'll need to input your Heroku API key, found in your <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/account"> Heroku account</a> page.  Voala!
Don't forget to set which branch you'd like to automatically push. </br>

I recommend creating a branch just for production but you can also do it for master or any other branch.</br>


It might seem daunting, connecting these three services together.  In fact this step by step process
doesn't have many pitfalls.  This integration will save you time and energy, while maximizing uptime
of your production server.
